## Question 1

**Question:**
IQ Test Item #1:

Complete the sequence logically: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?
Explain your reasoning.

**Answer:**
The given sequence appears to be increasing by multiples of 4, starting with 2. Here's how I arrived at the answer:

* 2 to 6 is an increase of 4
* 6 to 12 is an increase of 6 (which is a multiple of 4)
* 12 to 20 is an increase of 8 (also a multiple of 4)
* 20 to 30 is an increase of 10 (a multiple of 4 as well)

To find the next number in the sequence, we continue increasing by multiples of 4. The smallest multiple of 4 that makes the difference greater than or equal to the previous difference of 10 is 14:

* 30 + 14 = 44

So, the missing number in the sequence should be 44. This answer can be verified by continuing the pattern and checking if 44 fits in with the rest of the numbers:

* From 30 to 44 is an increase of 14 (a multiple of 4) which matches the pattern, so we have found the correct missing number.

## Question 2

**Question:**
IQ Test Item #2:

Complete the sequence logically: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ?
Explain your reasoning.

**Answer:**
36 is the next number in the sequence. The logic behind this sequence is that each number represents a perfect square (or an area of a square):

* 1 is the area of a 1x1 square
* 4 is the area of a 2x2 square (2*2=4)
* 9 is the area of a 3x3 square (3*3=9)
* 16 is the area of a 4x4 square (4*4=16)
* 25 is the area of a 5x5 square (5*5=25)

To find the next number, we need to find the area of a 6x6 square. This means multiplying 6 by itself: 6*6 = 36. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 36.

## Question 3

**Question:**
IQ Test Item #3:

If some bloops are razzies, and all razzies are lazzies, are all bloops definitely lazzies?
Explain using syllogistic logic.

**Answer:**
To solve this problem using syllogistic logic, we need to break it down into statements that follow the structure of a classic syllogism: Major premise (All P are Q), minor premise (Some S are P), and conclusion.

Major premise: All razzies are lazzies (P = razzies, Q = lazzies)
Minor premise: Some bloops are razzies (S = bloops)

From the given information, we can infer that some bloops are indeed lazzies. Here's how to set up the syllogism:

1. Major premise: All R are L (Razzies are Lazzies)
   - If something is a razzie, then it is a lazzy (Universal Affirmative)

2. Minor premise: Some B are R (Some bloops are razzies)
   - If something is a bloop, then it belongs to the set of some razzies (Particular Affirmative)

3. Conclusion: Some B are L (Some bloops are lazzies)
   - If something is a bloop and belongs to the set of some razzies, then it must be a member of the set of lazzies (Hypothetical Syllogism)

Therefore, according to syllogistic logic, some bloops are definitely lazzies.
