## Question 1

**Question:**
IQ Test Item #1:

Complete the sequence logically: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?
Explain your reasoning.

**Answer:**
To solve this sequence, we need to identify a pattern or rule that connects the given numbers.

Upon examining the sequence, I notice that each number is increasing by a certain amount:

* 6 - 2 = 4
* 12 - 6 = 6
* 20 - 12 = 8
* 30 - 20 = 10

The differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time (4, 6, 8, 10). Following this pattern, the next difference should be 12.

To find the next number in the sequence, I'll add 12 to the last term:

* 30 + 12 = 42

Therefore, my answer is: 42.

## Question 2

**Question:**
IQ Test Item #2:

Complete the sequence logically: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ?
Explain your reasoning.

**Answer:**
To complete the sequence logically, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence.

The given numbers are squares of integers: 

- 1^2 = 1
- 2^2 = 4
- 3^2 = 9
- 4^2 = 16
- 5^2 = 25

Following this pattern, we need to find the next square number.

The next integer would be 6 (since we're incrementing by 1), and its square is:

6^2 = 36

Therefore, the correct answer is: 36.

## Question 3

**Question:**
IQ Test Item #3:

If some bloops are razzies, and all razzies are lazzies, are all bloops definitely lazzies?
Explain using syllogistic logic.

**Answer:**
A classic example of a fallacious argument!

Using syllogistic logic, we can break down the argument as follows:

All Razzies are Lazzies ( Premise 1 )
Some Bloops are Razzies ( Premise 2 )

We want to conclude: All Bloops are definitely Lazzies.

However, from Premise 1 and Premise 2, we cannot logically deduce that all bloops are lazzies. We can only conclude that some bloops might be lazzies, but not necessarily all of them.

The conclusion is a non sequitur (it doesn't follow logically) because there's no information provided about the relationship between being a "bloop" and being a "lazzie". The premises don't provide enough context to make this inference.

This type of argument is called a "slippery slope fallacy" or "affirming the consequent", where we assume that if some instances are true, then all instances must be true.
